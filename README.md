## How to play
The goal of this game is to match three cards. However, matching is limited based on the card's attributes. A card has FOUR attributes, represented by the icons on the card.

The attributes are:
- Shape
- Amount
- Fill style
- Color

To be able to match three cards, either of the following rules should
apply for each individual attribute:
1. All attributes of this attribute type are equal to each other
2. All attributes of this attribute type are different from each other
